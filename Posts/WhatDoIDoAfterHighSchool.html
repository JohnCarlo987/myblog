<h1>What do I do after High School?</h1>
<p>This is one of the most common question asked to people like me. What am I going to do after I graduate highschool. For me, I think I want to go to a university and get a degree. As of right now, I have applied to Software Systems and Computing Science at SFU. <br> Why did I take it? As a kid growing up, I never got my hands on devices such as computers, iPads and even phones. Where I used to lived in the Philippines, there were no source of internet within an hour of where I lived. When my family moved to Canada on November 16, 2013, getting my hands on an iPad was a huge thing. I was addicted to it and I was really fascinated with device type related things.</p>

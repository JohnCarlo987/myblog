<h1>Capstone Project</h1>
<p>For my Capstone Project, I wanted to see if I could create a website without using any website builder tools like <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank">Wix</a>, <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Square Space</a> and all those companies that makes it easier for a certain amount of price. I wanted to take the challenge to learn how to make one myself. </p>
